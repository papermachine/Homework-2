    "Suppose a crime has been committed. Blood is found at the scene for which there is no innocent explanation. It is of a type which is present in 1% of the population.  The defendant is known to have this rare blood type.  The  prosecutor claims: “There is a 1% chance that the defendant would have the crime blood type if he were innocent. Thus there is a 99% chance that he guilty”. This is known as the prosecutor’s fallacy. What is wrong with this argument?"

    "One use of the naive Bayes classifier, which is still in practical use today, is as a spam filter.  Consider the corpus of text messages packaged with this homework, which are each labelled as either 'spam' or 'ham'.  In this case, naive Bayes utilizes a Bernoulli model that quantifies the probability of a given word given that the message is either spam or ham.  For example, investigating the text messages here, we find that the word *draw* shows up in spam 27 times, implying that\n",
    "$$P(X=\\mathrm{draw}|Y=\\mathrm{spam}) = \\frac{27}{25748} = \\frac{m_{draw,spam}}{m_{spam}},$$\n",
    "while in the case of ham, it shows up 5 times so\n",
    "$$P(X=\\mathrm{draw}|Y=\\mathrm{ham}) = \\frac{5}{67148} = \\frac{m_{draw,ham}}{m_{ham}}.$$\n",
    "Thus we see that the word 'draw' shows up with a much higher frequency in spam e-mails than in ham.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is not particularly strong evidence on its own, we can create a powerful classifier by using the naive assumption in conjunction with all the words in a given message:\n",
    "$$ P(Y=\\mathrm{ham}|X=x) \\propto P(Y=\\mathrm{ham}) \\prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i=x_i|Y=\\mathrm{ham}), $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y=\\mathrm{spam}|X=x) \\propto P(Y=\\mathrm{spam}) \\prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i=x_i|Y=\\mathrm{spam}), $$\n",
    "where $x_i$ are the words in a given message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write such a classifier.  I have taken the somewhat tedious step of parsing the data for you, yielding the variables *word_dictionary*, which contains the ham and spam counts for each word, as well as *training_labels*, which provides the spam/ham labels for each text message.  I have also parsed a set of test data: *test_messages* is a list, each entry containing another list of the words in the text message, as well as *test_labels* which contains the spam/ham label for each message."
